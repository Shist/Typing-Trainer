            Some people type as if they were born with a keyboard under their
            fingers, while others struggle with even the simplest of words. If
            you’re part of the second category, or even if you’re somewhere
            between categories, don’t worry several effective typing techniques
            can help you achieve an excellent typing speed.

            Daily practice is certainly required to achieve higher speeds and

            techniques and includes tips on how to practice them.

          <p class="main__text">
            The most important technique to learn to type faster is touch
            typing. This is a technique based on developing muscle memory for
            your fingers, and this is done by combining several other typing
            techniques into it.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Muscle memory</span> – By practicing
            regularly your fingers will be able to remember where the letters
            are on the keyboard, and you’ll be able to type not only without
            looking at the keyboard but also without consciously thinking about
            it.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Looking at the keys?</span> – At
            first, you will need to look at the keyboard, but in time, the need
            to look at the keys as you type will diminish. Some will say that
            looking at the keyboard should be avoided even at the beginning, but
            in my experience, you should only start doing that after you learn
            all the keys of the home row.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">3 Stages</span> – Learning touch
            typing is done in three steps: first you learn the home row of your
            keyboard, practice it until you know exactly where each letter is
            and can easily place your fingers in the correct position without
            looking at the keyboard.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            After this, you will learn to master the rows above and below the
            home row, the numbers row, and start practicing with special
            characters and upper case letters. Finally, the fun part: practicing
            on real texts!
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Tip</span> – To practice typing
            techniques you may need a suitable tutor. There are many available
            on the market. Here is a review of popular typing software to get
            you started.

          <h3 class="main__home-row-headline">
            2. Typing Techniques: The Home Row
          </h3>
          <img
            src="./assets/images/typing-technique-img-3.png"
            alt="Finger position to learn home row typing technique"
            class="main__home-row-img"
          />
          <p class="main__text">
            You may be wondering what the “home row” is, or you’re probably
            thinking that I’m referring to the keys near the “home” key, but I’m
            not, and the actual home row is the most important part of your
            keyboard and the one you (or rather your fingers) will know by heart
            after a couple of training sessions!
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">The home for fingers</span> – It’s
            called the home row because this is the home position for your
            fingers. This is the position that your fingers will return to after
            you finish typing something, and this is the position from which you
            will learn how to find all letters and characters on the keyboard.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Structure</span> – The home row is
            the row starting with the Caps Lock key, and if you look at your
            keyboard you will notice two small bumps or lines (depending on your
            keyboard) on the “<span class="main__bold-phrase">F</span>” and
            “<span class="main__bold-phrase">J</span>” key.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Positioning</span> – This is where
            your index fingers should reside. Your other fingers should rest on
            the keys to the left of the “<span class="main__bold-phrase">F</span
            >” key, for your left hand, and on the keys to the right of the
            “<span class="main__bold-phrase">J</span>” key, for your right hand.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Movements</span> – By doing this,
            your pinky fingers should be resting on the “<span
              class="main__bold-phrase"
              >A</span
            >” key and on the “<span class="main__bold-phrase">;</span>” key.
            Your thumbs will hover above the space key, and you can use either
            one to press it. Don’t try to use both at the same time, because it
            quickly gets confusing, trust me!
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">How to practice</span> – Spend some
            time getting your fingers familiar with this position, and learning
            the keys on the home row. Practice this typing technique each day,
            for several hours, until you can hit each key on the home row
            without looking at the keyboard.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Useful tools</span> – To make this
            easier, I encourage you to look for one of the numerous typing tools
            available online that allow you to practice the home row. Once you
            are comfortable with the position of the keys and you see that
            fingers automatically move to the key you want to hit, you are ready
            to move on to the next step!
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Training tip</span> –
            Congratulations, you are now the master of the home row! However, if
            you try to type anything you will see that the home row is not
            enough, and you’re not able to type anything other than “<span
              class="main__bold-phrase"
              >SAF</span
            >“, “<span class="main__bold-phrase">FDS</span>“, “<span
              class="main__bold-phrase"
              >KFS</span
            >” and so on. However, here is a brief list of words using the home
            row only.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            Not exactly impressive, after several weeks of exercise, is it?
            Well, don’t get disappointed now, because what you’ve done is
            solidify the basic part of your training!

            3. Typing Techniques: The Top Row

          />
          <p class="main__text">
            Now being familiar with the home row it’s time to move on to the top
            row. Did you know the longest words you can type on the Top Row are
            Typewriter and Quietwriter?
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Position</span> – Place your fingers
            in their default position on the home row, and look at the key above
            each of your fingers. For “<span class="main__bold-phrase">F</span>”
            this will be the “<span class="main__bold-phrase">R</span>” key, for
            “<span class="main__bold-phrase">J</span>” it will be the “<span
              class="main__bold-phrase"
              >U</span
            >” key, and so on. Each of your fingers should reach to the key
            directly above it, and start memorizing it.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            The only exception to this is your index fingers. They should be
            able to not only reach the “<span class="main__bold-phrase">F</span
            >” and “<span class="main__bold-phrase">J</span>” keys, but also the
            keys “<span class="main__bold-phrase">G</span>“, “<span
              class="main__bold-phrase"
              >H</span
            >“, and the keys directly above those as well. This is because your
            index finger is the most mobile and it’s easier to cover a larger
            number of keys with it.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Practicing</span> – Practice this
            typing technique until you know the top row just as well as the home
            row. Now try practicing with a larger text, and you’ll discover that
            suddenly you’re able to type a large number of words, without
            looking at the keyboard.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            This is an impressive feat, but you’re still not done! You have a
            whole new row to learn, plus the numpad!

          <h3 class="main__bottom-row-headline">
            4. Typing Techniques: The Bottom Row
          </h3>
          <p class="main__text">
            The bottom row is possibly the easiest row to master, because by
            now, due to all the practice you’ve had, your fingers are much more
            used to the motions of typing, and your muscle memory is starting to
            develop.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Technique</span> – All you have to
            do is learn the new letters of the bottom row using the same
            principles as the ones used for the top row. Now each of your
            fingers needs to learn the keys directly below it. Practice,
            practice, and then practice some more, because this is the final
            phase of your training!
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            After you’re satisfied with your progress and you’re able to type
            most regular words without looking at the keyboard, it’s time to
            move on to the real deal: texts!
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            <span class="main__bold-phrase">Training tip</span> – Exercising
            with words is fun, and it’s a perfect way of developing your finger
            memory, but the real test is typing a large paragraph from a book.
            You can find online tools for this as well, with some really diverse
            texts, perfect for getting you used to chain words together.
          </p>
          <h3 class="main__numpad-headline">5. The Numpad Typing Technique</h3>
          <p class="main__text">
            The numpad on a full-sized keyboard requires a typing technique in
            its own right. If you look at the 5 key you will see the same raised
            bar as on the “F” and “J” key. Unlike the home row, that is not the
            position for your index finger; it’s your middle finger that needs
            to be. Your index finger will rest on the “<span
              class="main__bold-phrase"
              >4</span
            >” key, while your ring finger will be on the “<span
              class="main__bold-phrase"
              >6</span
            >” key.
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            The keys directly above and below each finger are also part of their
            motion range, and the “<span class="main__bold-phrase">+</span>” or
            “<span class="main__bold-phrase">Enter</span>” key can be hit with
            either your pinky finger or your ring finger. Your thumb is reserved
            for the “<span class="main__bold-phrase">0</span>” key, and I
            strongly encourage you not to try to hit any other keys with it!
          </p>
          <p class="main__text">
            For laptops with a horizontal numeric bar, the positions are
            slightly different. In general, the left-hand serves the numbers
            from 1 to 5, the right hand the numbers and symbols from 6 to 0. In
            detail, you use the left pinky for 1, left ring finger for 2., left
            middle finger for 3, and the index fingers for 4 and 5. Mirror the
            position for the right hand. I give credit to my reader Andy
            Harrison.
