# Typing-Trainer

### This is a site that helps user to train his typing speed, learn about his weaknesses and view statistics on typed texts in his personal account.

---

### This project is hosted using the Vecel.com platform, you can see how it works here:

## https://shist-typing-trainer.vercel.app/

## Attention! Since the server side of the project works locally (http://localhost:3000) only after running the "npm run start-back" command in the terminal, the hosting site does not have access to the json server. So that is normal to run into the error "Error while checking user at database: TypeError: Failed to fetch" while trying to log in or register a new account.
